# Scale-invariants of human mobility and urban structure

### Abstract

Rapid and large-scale urbanization is one of the defining phenomena of the past few decades. Still, a number of important `puzzles' about city development remain poorly understood. This paper starts from the following two conundrums: first, despite the dramatic increase in the size of many cities have experienced, the commute distance and time seem to have remained remarkably stable. Second, the typical number of locations visited by an individual within a given time window appears like a constant quantity across a few cities of different size, despite the fact that large cities have more `explorable spaces'. A possible explanation of the above points has been searched in the constant travel budget hypothesis, which has been tested on empirical data. However, existing studies so far have been carried out on a small set of cities; relatively little is known about how mobility behaviors vary across cities largely differing in size. Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying the observed invariant behaviors are still not fully understood. Here, we analyze ~50 million individuals' location data from over 230 cities in China and empirically prove scale invariance of two key individual mobility characteristics: *number of visited locations* and *commuting distance*. We also highlight for the first time a universal `inverted U-shape' of the average commuting distance and time as a function of the distance from the city center, indicating that the city center's attraction on citizens is bounded. Finally, we develop an urban growth model that explains the empirical findings by taking the agglomeration and commuting constrains into account. The theoretical model is not only able to reproduce the observed scale-invariants and inverted U-shape curve of commuting distance, but it also shows how human mobility behavior determines the emergence of macroscopic urban spatial structure, and sheds light on the complex interplay between micro-level human decisions and macro-level urban phenomena.
