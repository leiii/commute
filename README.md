# Scale-invariance of human mobility and principles of urban growth

### Abstract

Large-scale urbanization is one of the defining phenomena of our century. Still, a number of puzzles about city development remain unsolved. This paper addressed two key puzzles. First, despite the dramatic increase in the size of many cities, the commute distance and time seem to have remained remarkably stable. Second, the typical number of locations visited by an individual within a given time window is approximately constant across cities of different sizes, despite the fact that large cities have more 'explorable spaces'. The constant travel budget hypothesis has been proposed to explain the above observations. However, empirical evidence is still inconclusive as it has been collected on just one city or a small set of cities; little is known about how human mobility behaviors vary across cities largely differing in size. Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying the observed scale-invariant behaviors are still not fully understood. Here, we analyze 50 million individuals' location data from over 230 cities in China with two orders of magnitude span in size, and empirically prove scale invariance of two key individual mobility characteristics: number of visited locations and commuting distance. We also highlight for the first time a universal 'inverted U-shape' of the average commuting distance and time as a function of the distance from the city center, indicating that the city center's attraction on citizens is bounded. Finally, we develop an urban growth model that explains the empirical findings by taking the agglomeration and commuting constrains into account. The model faithfully reproduces the observed mobility characteristics, and connects individual-level commuting choices with macroscopic urban spatial structure.
