# Universal patterns of urban commuting across and within cities

### Abstract

Commuting networks construct the backbone of cities and are considered to be a determining component of urban spatial structure. Despite the crucial role of urban commuting, little is known about how it varies across and within cities largely differing in size. Here, using 50 million individuals' mobile phone data from 234 Chinese cities with over two orders of magnitude span in size, we empirically show two urban commuting laws: (i) the scale-invariance of the average commuting distance (across cities) and (ii) the universal `inverted U-shape' of the average commuting distance as a function of the distance from the city center (within cities), indicating that the city center's attraction on citizens is bounded. We develop an urban growth model that explains the above empirical findings. The model faithfully reproduces the observed commuting characteristics, connects individual-level mobility choices with macroscopic urban spatial structure, and could be applied to a variety of fields such as biology and ecology.
